#### Currently Under Development.
Some help would be appreciated.

**Introduction to `this.dom` in the context of Standardized Data Structuring**

 Every web page is **built on the Document Object Model (DOM)**. `this.dom` abstracts this structure, presenting the DOM in a standardized format. It ensures that every interaction, every element, and every change on the web page is captured and structured uniformly.

### Example Usage:
```js
const ThisDom = require('this.dom.js');
// Let's say you want to standardize the body of the HTML document
const bodyElement = document.body;
const domInstance = new ThisDom(bodyElement);
domInstance.standardize();
console.log(domInstance.getStandardizedRepresentation());
```

This code takes an HTML DOM element, standardizes it by converting it into a uniform object structure, and then logs this structured representation. The structure includes the tag name, attributes, textual content, and children (which recursively have the same structure).

**Note:** This is a basic setup. Depending on the complexity of your needs, you may need to extend this class with more features and functionalities.

# Context of Abstraction for Machine Learning Standardization
Traditional web development elements, from images to audio, are designed mainly for display and interaction. But what if they could be seamlessly converted into standardized formats primed for machine learning? That's the vision behind the **all.this** modules.

An Introduction to the all.this Library: Standardizing Web Development Elements for Machine Learning.

## Principles Behind the this. Library:
- ### **Abstraction for ML:**
 The library's core principle is to abstract traditional web elements so that they're immediately primed for machine learning. It's about viewing web content not just as data but as structured, consistent, and standardized data.

- ### **Built on Web Standards:** 
Rooted in JavaScript, the this. library builds upon public web development standards. The aim is to ensure that developers remain within familiar territories, even as they venture into the world of machine learning.

- ### **Open and Collaborative:** 
The this. library champions open standards. By leveraging public web standards, it invites collaboration, hoping to create a community that continually refines and enhances the bridge between web development and machine learning.
